      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post, I talked about how I want to create this tower defense game as a challenge to myself. It was for a student assignment but then it turned into something that I can use as a way to prove myself that I can complete things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some time passed after that and I actually finished the game. Yayyyy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our course professor gave us a deadline for a first draft of the project and I managed to finish the game before it. I was working hard for days and created a complete game with all the features and screens we planned. But after that, something happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
