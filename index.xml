      <description>&lt;p&gt;The spring semester has started and I need to prepare a term project assignment for my students. It will be a game project and they will implement it with Java and JavaFx. I know, Java is not very exciting for game development but it is their first year and so far they only learned Java. The professor wants to make them complete a project with the things they learned.&#xA;One day, we were brainstorming game ideas with the other teaching assistant and we decided to make a tower defense game. It will be suitable for our students. It&amp;rsquo;s not very hard to implement but also still challenging on its own ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
